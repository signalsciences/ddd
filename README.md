# (data)dogdirect

Directly send metrics to [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) via the HTTP API using [golang](https://golang.org).

# What Problem Are We Solving?

Using DataDog's SasS offering to upload time series data when you can't use the official DataDog agent.

In general, you should use the official DataDog agent.  It's great.  Use it.  But, sometimes you can't or won't run the official DataDog agent.  This could be because:

* You are on a constrained environment with low resources
* You don't want alien code running in your environment
* You don't want to run agent process along side your application.
* You don't want to run dedicated container to run the DataDog agent (per cluster or per availability zone).

So if you can't (or won't run the datadog), package provides a simple interface for counters and gauges and uploads data using the HTTP API (the same one the DataDog agent uses).

# What does this do?

* Stores your metrics locally supporting both counters and gauges.
* Timinig and Histograms are supported but the descriptive statistics are hardwired and not configurable (but easy to add).
* Allows setting a global namespace
* Allows setting global tags (applied to every metric)
* Uploads your metrics to DataDog every 15 seconds

# What doesn't this do?

* Anything that's not a guage or counter or histogram: logs, traces, service checks, events.
* Error handling is probably not awesome.  Pull requests welcome.

## Offical HTTP API Documentation

THe offical HTTP API documentation on [metrics](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=bash#metrics)

> We store metric points at the 1 second resolution, but weâ€™d prefer if you only submitted points every 15 seconds. Any metrics with fractions of a second timestamps gets rounded to the nearest second, and if any points have the same timestamp, the latest point overwrites the previous ones.

## datadog-go

In particular, much of this code is based on [statsd.go](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-go/blob/master/statsd/statsd.go).   I have mixed feelings about the "watcher" being glued into the main object but seems to work for now.

Interestingly, the buffered implimentation doesn't consolidate anything.  If you do 100 increments of a single stat, it will send 100 statsd messages.

## datadog-agent

The golang [datadog agent](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent) has some nuggest, especially the [metrics](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/tree/master/pkg/metrics).  Unfortunately the metrics package can't be used standalone as it glues in a bunch of extraneous stuff specific to DataDog (logging, configuration).  That's too bad.

## strip/veneue

[stripe/veneue](https://github.com/stripe/veneur) is a statds server on sterioids.  It uses the HTTP API as well.

See the [datadog section]( https://github.com/stripe/veneur/tree/master/sinks/datadog) and the [http.go](https://github.com/stripe/veneur/blob/master/http/http.go) for details.
